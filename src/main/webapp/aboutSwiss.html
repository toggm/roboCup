		<h2>About Swiss-system tournament</h2>
		Swiss system is one of one of the most popular tournament systems for
		logic games. <br /> It has these goals and benefits: <br /> <br />
		<ul>
			<li>The system takes care of all players, does not focus itself
				only on the winners. Each player will have an estimate of his skill
				in the tournament. And even if your first opponent will be the
				future winner -- you'll still have a good chance to take a good
				place in the results table.</li>
			<li>All players play an equal number of rounds. There are no
				idle rounds when you're only waiting for someone else to play.</li>
			<li>With advancement of the tournament your opponents will be
				picked up closer to you by strength.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Formal rules</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>All players play an equal number of rounds.</li>
			<li>Number of rounds depends on number of participants: <br />
				<table>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>5-8 players</td>
							<td>9-16 players</td>
							<td>17-32 players</td>
							<td>33-64 players</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>5 rounds</td>
							<td>6 rounds</td>
							<td>7 rounds</td>
							<td>8 rounds</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
			</li>
			<li>The goal of a player is to take as much tournament points as
				possible. Each win gives 4 points, each draw gives 2 points, each
				loss gives 1 point.</li>
			<!--<li>If rating import is used, each player gets (zagram rating /-->
				<!--100) tournament points at start.</li>-->
			<li>At start of each round all players are sorted by obtained
				points. The strongest player is matched in a game with the second.
				The third with the fourth. And so on.
				Minor permutations are used to avoid game duplicates (same opponents twice).
				<br />
				Example. Suppose
				players had 17, 15, 14, 13, 13, 11 points. Then assigned games will
				be: <br /> "17"-"15", &nbsp; &nbsp; "14"-"some of the 13", &nbsp; &nbsp; "the
				other 13"-"11".</li>
		</ul>
